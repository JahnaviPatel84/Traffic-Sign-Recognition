# üö¶ Traffic Sign Recognition with Explainable Deep Learning

A full-stack deep learning project that combines robust classification of German traffic signs using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with interpretability powered by Grad-CAM. The system is production-ready, featuring a Streamlit web app interface and modular training pipeline.

## üìå Project Objective

> **Goal:** Build a scalable and interpretable computer vision system for real-time traffic sign recognition using CNNs trained on the GTSRB dataset, and empower end-users with **visual explanations** of model decisions through Grad-CAM.

---

## üß† Model Architecture

- **Model:** Custom CNN with 3 convolutional layers + ReLU + MaxPool + Dropout + FC layers
- **Input size:** 32√ó32 RGB images
- **Output:** 43 softmax-activated class probabilities
- **Training Acc:** ~99%  
- **Validation Acc:** ~97%

The model is trained from scratch and optimized using the Adam optimizer with categorical cross-entropy loss.

## üîç Explainability with Grad-CAM

This project integrates **Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping)** to highlight spatial regions in the input that influence the model‚Äôs decision. Grad-CAM helps diagnose:
- Overfitting or spurious correlations
- Model reliance on texture vs shape
- Failure cases and class confusion

Grad-CAM overlays are available both in-batch (`notebooks/2_gradcam_analysis.ipynb`) and live within the Streamlit UI.
